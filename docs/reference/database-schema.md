# Database schema

We use DynamoDB, which is "schemaless" meaning the fields are not formally defined within the database itself. Nevertheless we obviously have a consistent format for our data, which is described below.

| PK                            | fields                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ROOM:[roomId]                 | hostKey, validSizes, isVoteRevealed |
| ROOM:[roomId]:USERS:[userKey] | userName                            |
| ROOM:[roomId]:VOTES:[userKey] | userName, currentVote               |

## Fields

| Name           | Description                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| roomId         | Randomly generated ID (public)                           |
| hostKey        | Randomly generated key (private, known only to the host) |
| validSizes     | Space-delimited list of valid sizes e.g. `1 2 3`         |
| isVoteRevealed | `true` if users are allowed to see all votes             |
| userKey        | Randomly generated key (known only to the given user)    |
| userName       | A display name to use.                                   |
| currentVote    | The current vote for the user. One of `validSizes`       |

## Operations

- **Create room** generates ID/hostKey and inserts `ROOM:[roomId]` with default sizes (`1 2 3 5 8 13 20 ? âˆž`) and `isVoteRevealed=false`.
- **Update sizes** updates the value of `validSizes` for the given room key
- **Join room** Generates a `userKey` and creates a USER row with the given `userName`
- **Vote** Upserts VOTE for the given `userKey`
- **Reveal cards** Sets `isVoteRevealed` to `true` which allows users to see the value of `currentVote` for all users.
- **Reset** Sets `isVoteRevealed` to `false` and deletes all VOTES rows
- **Delete user** Deletes the USER and VOTE rows for the given `userKey`
- **Delete room** Deletes all rows with the `ROOM[roomId]` prefix
