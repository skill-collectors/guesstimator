This page explains how and why we document.

**Why such a focus on documentation?** The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) explicitly values "Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation," so why are we putting all this work into a complete documentation site? First, we want this project to be really easy for new people to start working on, so spending a little extra effort making it easy to find answers is worth it. Second, writing good documentation is a skill worth developing, and building this site is a good way to practice it.

**Why not use a wiki?** By making this a site within the repo itself, we get the following benefits over a wiki:

- We have more control over the organization and layout
- PRs can include updates to documentation
- Everyone has a local copy when they clone the repo
