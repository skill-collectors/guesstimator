### How these docs are organized

The different sections of this site are inspired by [the documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/) described by Divio on their site. New content should be organized as follows:

- **Tutorials** that walk someone through a learning exercise go in the `tutorials` directory.
- **How-to guides** that explain how to perform a specific task go in the `how-to` directory.
- **Reference documentation** that provide technical descriptions go in the `reference` directory.
- **Explanation** and background infromation go in the `context` directory.

All pages should be linked from the home page `index.md` which serves as a table of contents for the site.
